All initial processing (fastq download and qiime taxonomic assignment) was done locally. Afterwards, files are processed on the cluster

`download_sra.sh` 
`download_sra.sh` takes a SRR_Acc_List.txt and downloads all the fastq files for the given accessions. It automatically
loop over the project IDs provided in as an array called "projects" within `download_sra.sh`.

How to run:
- Change the projects in the array named "projects" to your desired project(s). 
        - The script assumes you named your folders with the project name. All of this can be changed.
- Open command prompt and navigate to the scripts folder.
- Run the following command: `download_sra.sh > sra.log 2>&1` 
- Output: a file in the scripts folder called sra.log which contains std error and std Output.


Processing Notes:
- PRJEB3232 and PRJEB3250: only have one read per spot.



 ### provide accessions:
    ### automatically makes folders then downloads data (run table... then renames to project_run_table and accession list)
